## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Using media queries to change how elements behave according to screen size.

```css
@media only screen and (min-width: 375px) {
    .recipe-page-component {
        max-width: 720px;
        border-radius: 2rem;
    }

    .hero-image > img {
        display: block;
        margin: 1.5rem auto 1rem;
        width: 92%;
        border-radius: 1rem;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

Using Javascript to create drop down sections in the recipe card.
